## Go-to market stratergy
To have a competitive advantage while integrating seamlessly with online shopping in Krisshop, having an all software product with little or no external support is crucial. 

Our go to market strategy involves supply chain management on and off air to have 70% higher performance. It will help us deliver sizeable products with better reliability and traceability in an end to end manner. Tho we cannot completely remove ground work we can help assist already built supply chain system to deliver more. Adding more revenue to the system just by products that can directly be delivered to the destination with 100 percent reliability and to the user with no rebound whatsoever.
